# Windays2015
Source code from demo app that I did on Microsoft Windays 2015 conference held in Umag, Croatia. Demo consists of ASP.NET WebAPI project which demonstrates advanced usage of this popular framework for building Restful services on .NET platform.

Demo covers following ASP.NET WebAPI topics:

* Message Handlers (DelegatingHandler)
* Filters (ActionFilterAttribute)
* Formatters (MediaTypeFormatter)
* Exception Handling (ExceptionLogger and ExceptionHandler)
* HTTP caching (cache control plus etag)
* HTTP streaming (chunked transfer upload/download - PushStreamContent and ReadAsStreamMultipartAsync)
